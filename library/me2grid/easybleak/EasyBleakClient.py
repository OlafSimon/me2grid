    """! @brief Object to commuinicate to devices by BLE for synchronous programming
    
        This object represents a BLE device and enables communication to it, serving as a BLE client. \n
        It is especially usable within the python 'shell'. \n
        The EasyBleakClient wraps an BleakClient objct from the 'bleak' Library and avoids the need of using the 'asyncio'
        library making programming much easier, especially for beginners. Such way, the usage equals to libraries like
        'BLE_GATT' or 'bluepi' and simplifies migration to the hardware independent 'bleak' library.
     
        @code{.py}
        client = EasyBleakCient('[Bluetooth MAC Address]')
        client.connect()
        data = client.read('[UUID]')
        client.disconnect()
        @endcode

            data = client.read('[UUID]')
        @endcode
            
        The simplest usage is just calling the 'read' method. The connection and disconnection process will be executed automaticall.
        Due to the connection and disconnection process at each call this type of access is very slowly.
