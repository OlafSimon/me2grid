        @ section SEC_GATT Predefined readable services, represented as enumerations of characteristics

        To receive a more readable code for characteristic access, enumerations for each service are provided.
        Use the static \ref gatt method to recieve a dictionary of named services and their enumeration classes
        representing the dedicated characteristics. See the gatt.GATT_Dict class for further information. \n
        The basic usage e.g. for the BLE device client \ref EasyBleakClient and its derived classes is:

        @code{.py}

        print(GATT_Dict.gatt()
        
        from EasyBleak import EasyBleak

        service = EasyBleak.gatt()['DeviceInformatonService']
        print(service.toString())
        characteristic = service.MODEL
        print(characteristic.uuid)

        from gatt import DeviceInformationService
        service = DeviceInformationService
        print(service.uuidService())
        characteristic = DeviceInformationService.MODEL
        print(characteristic.uuid)
        @endcode
        
        In case you know a characteristic e.g. from a manual you can search for the corresponding readable enumeration:
        
        @code{.py}
        from gatt import GATT_Dict
        service = GATT_Dict.fromUUID("0000180a-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb")
        print(service)
        characteristic = GATT_Dict.fromUUID("00002a24-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb")
        print(characteristic)
        print(characteristic.uuid)
        @endcode
        
        @ section SEC_PRINTSERVICES Printing of the Services actually present within the device      
        
        The method \ref printServices prints all content provided from the GATT server device. This is the information
        actually read from the device. This method deliveres a string representation of the BleakClient.services property.

        @ section SEC_READWRITE Disconnection safe methods 'read', 'write', 'request' and 'disconnect'

        The methods \ref read and \ref write provide an error free access to characteristics. A (single) reconnection will be executed,
        in case the external device disconnected without notice in the meantime.The methods are functional identical to
        'read_gatt_char' and 'write_gatt_char' of the 'BleakClient' base class. In case the reconnection fails an EOFError
        is raised.

        @ section TYPE_READWRITE The methods 'read' and 'write' use characteristic specific types ('str', 'int') instead of just 'bytearray'.

        In case you specify the uuid parameter as a \ref BaseService, which is the the base type of the entities of
        all service enumeration, such as DeviceInformationService.MODEL, the 'data' parameter or return value can be given or
        are received in the real type like str or int the characteristic is aimed to represent.

        of command and response characteristics. In such cases a coded command is written to the command characteristic
        and the device will response with a coded result from the response characteristic. If the vendor does not
        provide a service name for the command and response characteristics, the service shall be called 'RequestServie'! \n
