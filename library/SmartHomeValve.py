    @brief Simple smart home application controlling a radiator valve by an window reed contact
    
    The application controlls a BLE connected radiator valve CC_RT_BLE from EQ-3 by sensing an open window using the reed relai from a
    TI Sensor Tag. This application serves as a first and very simple (but already effectively energy saving) sample program for the direct
    usage of BLE controlled external devices. It does not implement any smart home or smart factory related concept.
